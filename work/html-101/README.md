## Assignment

Create these pages _in this directory_

links.html (Links)
index.html (Home) 
images.html (Images)
form.html (Form)

Each should load two CSS files: 
- `shared.css` that holds styling common to all the files
- NAME.css, which is different for each file (e.g. links.css, index.css, etc)

Each file will have a header menu navigation with two top level menus

The first menu will link to the above documents, except the current page will not be a link and will be bolded.
- These menus will have to be nearly the same in each file.  Later we will see ways to remove the duplication

The second menu will link to Google, Amazon, Facebook, and one work-safe site of your choice

- Links - In addition to the menu, the page has links to all the menu items in the body
- Home - Has a introductory text that says your favorite pet species.
- Images - embed 3 images of cats (using ```<img>``` tags), each 150 pixels wide and all on one line with no spaces between - use CSS to size, not HTML
- Form - Has a text input box asking for name, and a dropdown that picks one of the pages, and a submit button that sends you to the Home page.

HTML and CSS only, no outside libraries, no JS.

Do not use `float` or HTML tables

Beyond the assignment, style your pages to be somewhat attractive and understandable as menus and content
