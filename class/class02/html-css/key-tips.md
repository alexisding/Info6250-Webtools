# Key tips for CSS and HTML

## HTML

* class names in lower kebab-case
* don't overuse id attribute
* class names that describe the content structure, not the appearance, not the content
* Semantic structure of HTML where you can
* Don't rely on browser to fix bad markup 
* Don't embed CSS or JS in markup

## CSS

* Don't rely on specific tag structure (e.g. "ul > li > p span" will easily break)
* Don't use too many parts in your selectors
* Use browser debugger to check for box model, css inheritance, block vs inline, etc
* Use browser debugger to temporarily modify CSS in place to test theories
